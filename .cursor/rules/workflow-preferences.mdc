# Coding workflow preferences

- I use Windows to develop my application, so Linux commands do not work in here
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how
feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly
instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
